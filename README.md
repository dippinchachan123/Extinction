The natural resources of the Earth have been depleted...but scientist have found a mysterious planet which is itself a living entity in itself,the planet has resources inside it,but the size of the planet is extremelt large and ore density is relatively low...so,it will took years to search the high ore density region on its surface...but the planet is itself living,it can talk in its own language(which we have to decode) by understanding its Linguistics.
#
By doing years of research scientist have made some high technical probes and tools to control,and interact with the planet.
